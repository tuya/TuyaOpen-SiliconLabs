SiWx917 flashing hook for `tos.py flash`.

tools/cli_command/cli_flash.py looks for platform_flash_bridge.py in the
selected platform's root and, when present, calls platform_flash() instead of
tyutool.

Simplicity Commander can reach this part over two physically different
channels, and both can write either firmware:

    channel        command                 needs
    -------------  ----------------------  ------------------------------------
    SWD / J-Link   commander rps load      a debug probe on SWCLK/SWDIO
    serial / ISP   commander serial load   ISP mode (GPIO_34 low, then Reset)

Both take a .rps and route it by the image type in its RPS header, so the same
command writes either the M4 application or the NWP/TA wireless firmware.
Writing both means writing two images in sequence; a single merged image was
tried and does not load (see the comment next to _find_ta_image).

`rps load` uploads a flash-loader algorithm into RAM and lets it drive the NWP
bootloader -- the mechanism AN1497 (SiWx917 SoC SWD Algorithm Programmer)
documents. Commander prints "Uploading flashloader..." when it does this. No ISP
keypress is involved on this path.

    Earlier revisions of this file claimed SWD had no working path for NWP/TA
    firmware. Measured 2026-08-20 on a DK2605A: `rps load <ta>.rps --tif SWD`
    completes and the board boots. Two boards have now been written this way.

    A completed write is still not a started radio. On one board the write
    reported DONE, `mfg917 info` read the new version back, and the application
    never printed a line -- until the board was power-cycled, after which it
    came up normally. The install looks to be finalised at reset, and the reset
    Commander issues over a plain J-Link does not always do it. Power-cycle
    after writing NWP firmware before concluding anything.

Channel and target are both chosen from a menu rather than guessed, so what got
detected is visible before anything is written. -p <port> and the SIWX917_*
environment variables below skip the prompts for CI and production programming.

Writing NWP/TA firmware erases the radio's flash first; an interrupted write has
left a board needing recovery. It therefore happens only when explicitly asked
for, never as a repair for firmware that is merely different. When a device
flashes cleanly and the radio still will not start, see BOOT_FAILURE_HINTS.

This module is loaded by importlib.util.spec_from_file_location() under a
synthetic module name, so its package context is not set up and it cannot
import the platform's script.util helpers -- hence the local platform.system()
call instead of reusing get_system_name().

#   rps convert nwp_c.rps --nwpapp <ta>.rps --combinedimage
#   rps convert combined.rps --app m4_c.rps --nwpapp nwp_c.rps
#
# Three steps because `rps convert` refuses inputs that do not already carry
# the COMBINED_IMAGE flag ("Image does not have the COMBINED_IMAGE flag set;
# cannot combine this image!"), and neither the image built here nor the one
# the SDK ships has it.
#
# But writing the result did not work. Measured 2026-08-20 on a DK2605A, with
# a 2478720-byte merged image that `rps convert` produced without complaint:
#
#   $ commander rps load combined.rps -d SiWG917M111MGTBA --tif SWD
#   Uploading flashloader...
#   Waiting for flashloader to become ready
#   Writing data...
#   ERROR: Waiting for flashloader failed: 0 - Flashloader is not ready
#
# The board was undamaged (radio still booted, version unchanged), so nothing
# was committed. Cause unknown -- possibly the size, possibly that the merged
# image presents an M4 header with the NWP image appended and the flash-loader
# takes the M4 path. The same command with the NWP image alone (1668000 bytes)
# succeeds and the radio comes up, so the channel is fine.
#
# Writing the two images one after another uses only operations that have each
# been verified on hardware, so that is what this does. If you want to revisit
# the merged path, the recipe above is the starting point.
